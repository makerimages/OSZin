# OS Zin
OS Zin is a hobbyist OS, built mostly from scratch and in development since 30.12.2014.

This repository contains the source code and a build script for a ```i686-elf``` targeting assembler and cross-compiler. Find instructions on how to make yours [here](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler)

## Thank you:
The wiki, forums and IRC of osdev.org for being there. If it weren't for them, I'd still be stuck at writing a bootloader.
